# Store-IT (project-name)

Comprehensive README for the Store-IT Next.js application. This document explains the project purpose, architecture and full developer flow: how to set up, run, build, test and deploy the app. It also lists the tech stack, directory layout, required environment variables and troubleshooting tips.

## Project overview

Store-IT is a Next.js 13+ app using the App Router. It's a starter e-commerce / admin dashboard style project that demonstrates a modern React + Next.js architecture with server and client components, Tailwind CSS, modular UI components, and optional Appwrite integration for backend services (auth, database, storage). The repo contains app-level components, UI primitives and utility libraries to scaffold a production-ready storefront or admin panel.

Key features (example):

- Next.js App Router with server and client components
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Reusable UI primitives under `components/ui`
- Dashboard and auth flows under `app/` with nested layouts
- Utilities and client actions under `app/_lib/` (e.g., Appwrite helpers)

## Tech stack

- Next.js (App Router) — React framework for server rendering and routing
- React — UI library
- Tailwind CSS — Utility-first styling
- Appwrite (optional) — Backend-as-a-service for auth, database and storage (helpers present in `app/_lib/appwrite`)
- Vercel-friendly configuration (next.config.mjs)
- ESLint — linting rules included
- PostCSS — CSS processing

Optional tools used in development or build artifacts:

- Node.js (v18+ recommended)
- pnpm / npm / yarn — package manager

## Architecture & flow

High-level flow (developer and runtime):

1. Visitor requests a page. Next.js resolves the route in the `app/` folder using nested layouts.
2. Server components run on the server to fetch data (e.g., from Appwrite or other APIs) using helper functions in `app/_lib/` or `lib/`.
3. Client components (files using 'use client' or UI primitives) hydrate on the browser to provide interaction (modals, forms, client-only state).
4. Auth flows are handled in the `(auth)` route group; auth helpers or SDK wrappers (Appwrite) live in `app/_lib/appwrite`.
5. Form submissions or actions may call API Routes (serverless functions) or Appwrite SDK directly from the client.

Data flow notes:

- Server components should perform secure data fetching and only pass minimal props to client components.
- For optimistic UI or real-time features, use client-side fetches or subscriptions via Appwrite/websockets where appropriate.

## Directory structure

Below are the most relevant folders with short descriptions (trimmed to main areas):

- `app/` — Next.js App Router routes, layouts and components for pages. Contains route groups like `(auth)` and `(root)`.
- `components/` — Shared UI components and primitives in `components/ui`.
- `app/_components/` — App-scoped components used by routes (cards, header, sidebar, etc.).
- `app/_lib/` — App-level libraries and helpers (Appwrite integration, actions, uploads).
- `constants/` — Static constants used across the app.
- `hooks/` — Custom React hooks (e.g., `use-toast`).
- `lib/` — Generic utilities (e.g., `utils.js`).
- `public/` — Static assets (images, icons).
- `.next/` — Next.js build output (ignored by source control in normal projects).

## Environment variables

This project expects a few environment variables for production/development if Appwrite (or another backend provider) is used. The example names and purposes below are inferred from the repo structure — adjust names to match your own setup.

- APPWRITE_ENDPOINT - Appwrite API endpoint (e.g. https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1)
- APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID - Appwrite project ID
- APPWRITE_API_KEY - Appwrite API key (server-side only)
- NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT - public endpoint used from the browser
- NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID - public project id for client SDK

Create a `.env.local` in the project root and add the above variables when using Appwrite. Do not commit secrets.

Example `.env.local` (do not commit):

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT=https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1
NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
APPWRITE_API_KEY=server_api_key
```

If you don't use Appwrite, remove or ignore the `app/_lib/appwrite` references and use your preferred backend.

## Local setup (development)

Prerequisites:

- Node.js 18+ (LTS recommended)
- A package manager: npm, pnpm or yarn

Steps:

1. Clone the repository and change into the project folder (where this README lives):

   cd project-name

2. Install dependencies:

   npm install

   or with pnpm:

   pnpm install

3. Create `.env.local` and populate environment variables described above if you plan to use Appwrite or other services.

4. Start the dev server:

   npm run dev

By default, Next.js will run at http://localhost:3000.

Available npm scripts (check `package.json` for exact names):

- `dev` — Start development server
- `build` — Build for production
- `start` — Run built production server
- `lint` — Run ESLint

## Build & production run

1. Build the app:

   npm run build

2. Start the production server:

   npm run start

Or use a platform-specific adapter (Vercel uses `next build` / `next start` automatically on deploy).

## Deployment hints

- Vercel: The repository is Next.js-ready. Connect the repo in Vercel and set environment variables in the Vercel dashboard. Vercel will run `npm install` and `npm run build` by default.
- Other hosts: Ensure Node.js 18+ and `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` environment variables are set. Use `npm run build` then `npm run start`.
- If using Appwrite functions or server-side API keys, keep those secrets server-side (do not expose `APPWRITE_API_KEY` to the browser).

## Troubleshooting & common issues

- Build errors about missing environment variables: Create `.env.local` and populate variables. Restart dev server.
- CSS not applied: Ensure `globals.css` includes Tailwind directives and `tailwind.config.js` is present. Rebuild if necessary.
- Appwrite errors: Verify endpoints and project ID. Check CORS and client SDK configuration.
- Port in use: Specify PORT environment variable or stop the conflicting process.

If you hit an error you can't resolve, open an issue and include the error message, Node version, and steps to reproduce.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Minimal guidelines:

1. Fork the repo and create a feature branch.
2. Run lint and tests (if present) before opening a PR.
3. Write clear commit messages and a brief PR description explaining the change.

## License

Specify the project license here (MIT, Apache-2.0, etc.). If you don't have a license file in the repo, add one and reference it.

If you'd like, I can also:

- Add a short Quick Start section tailored to whether you use Appwrite or a custom API.
- Generate a `.env.example` file with the recommended variables.
- Add CI workflow examples (GitHub Actions) for running tests/lint/build.

Tell me which of those you'd like and I'll add them next.
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
